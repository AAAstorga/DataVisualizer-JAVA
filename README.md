### Project Description

### Tools and Technology


### The Repository Details
The repository consists of a single "src" folder that is the root of the packages used by the JAVA files inside. This "src" folder can be used as the Source Folder within any JAVA based IDE. Specific instructions on how to use it with NetBeans, which has been used originally to develop this project, are present in the [Instructions](https://github.com/GHCFOSS/DataVisualizer-JAVA/wiki) wiki.

The root "src" folder contains three pakcages: com.ghc.foss.ds, com.ghc.foss.frames and com.ghc.foss.images. The first two contain code files and third, as the name suggests, images.

### How to work on an Issue
1. If there is a particular existing issue that you would like to fix, please leave a comment below it detailing how you intend to fix it and the project owners will assign it to you. This will reduce duplication of effort. However, we would expect an update on the issue (code and/or comment and/or discussion) in the next 7 days. If we do not hear back from the assignee, we will remove the assignment so that other interested contributors can work on it.
2. If you would like to propose an enhancement, or report a bug that you would like to work on, feel free to open new issues and we will assign them to you.
